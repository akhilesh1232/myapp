<br /><span className="tab"></span>The series is based on a Horror fiction novel “Haunting of hill house” written by Shirley Jackson. The story of the series is based on Crain family and incidents about the spine-chilling and mysterious house they used to live in. Steve, Eleanor, Theodora, Luke, Shirley are all siblings and Hugh and Olivia are their parents. The Hugh and his wife Olivia were in poor financial condition hence they purchased a old manor and thought that after renovation they could sell that at the elevated price. For renovation, they stayed in that mansion but there was a haunting past releated to that house. The time they lived there, all the siblings were minor and the story tells us how this all weird and frightening sort of things happened in the house made their impact on the lives of respective characters.Now all the siblings are grown up and independent. Their mother had strange kind of impact of all of such weird things on her mind which eventually lead to death of her, leaving her children clueless about tragedy happened to their mother, and now they are not so close with their father because children hold father responsible for catastrophic death of their mother.
<br /><br /><strong className = "btn btn-success">Things I liked</strong><br /><br /><span className="tab"></span>Story starts from the suicide of the Eleanor/ Nell Crain(Twin sister of Luke Crain) in the same old house.The horror things start to happen and we come across the many past events from each of characters’ life which perfectly explains how the events happened in childhood could affect the personality of the person. The narration is combination of the past events from their life and current scenes and this explores the relationships in family very well. The star cast has also performed well in every scenario, either it may be tensed arguments or scary horror scenes or the story revealing climax scenes(Especially the scene of suicide of Nell). The show is excellently directed and written if we consider the darkness of story, mystery elevating silence , management of the screen appearance and significance of all the characters till end etc. Another quality of the show is, it ends well. The ending of story is appropriate and nothing exaggerating is shown. The scenes which describe the relationship of children and their mother are incredibly well filmed. They are directed in such a way that you are left with no choice other than to love the kind of bond they share. 
<br /><br /><strong className="btn btn-warning">Things I didn't like</strong><br /><br /><span className="tab"></span>Even though show contains ghosts but the ghosts are dead men and are not much scary. The scary scenes fails to scare you, that may be the downfall. The darkness of shooting and story seems more horror than the actual ghosts and scary scenes. (One who don’t like the frightening scenes might like this quality).
