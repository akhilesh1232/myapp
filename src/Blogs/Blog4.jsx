                            On the 15th August, the Taliban took control of the last province and capital Kabul, incumbent president Mr. Ashraf Ghani fled the country leaving the countrymen in a dire situation. Since the Taliban had to show their progressive side to the world, a spokesperson of Taliban even gave an interview to a female interviewer on national TV, more importantly it was uncut. But an even more surprising thing is, as promised by the Taliban, the power transition from democratically elected government to Taliban was really peaceful (since the members belong to peaceful community, it's conspicuous). There was no blood shading involved, no genocide was done (yet), no embassies were burnt, no ambassadors were killed neither any political opponent of the Taliban was decapitated (It has to be clarified since above mentioned things have happened in Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt recently in Myanmar etc. during military take over). But all the above things are past and what we should be interested in, must be the future. The few things, I suspect, might take the different turn are as follows: 
<br/>
<h4 className='py-3'>1. Position of USA in global lobbying</h4>

 After deploying an army for 20 years in Afg, the results are certainly disappointing for the USA. In the long run, America has not only lost $28 Trillion, but something more precious than that. For many years, the Americans were asking questions why our forces are in Afg? And the classic answer by policymakers, used to be, “to build an army of AFG that will protect its pro-democratic government”. Indubitably, all the money, ammunition, logistics and most importantly morality has proven implacable. But most importantly, what the USA has lost is its credibility. The USA has always been known to its allies for its pro-democratic values and responsible behaviour(though, most of the time it's just sugar-coating). History has witnessed, vacuum or imbalance of power has always resulted in wars or destruction or establishment of an inhumane regime like the Taliban. And removal of US forces has just helped to create something very similar. Current state of the Middle East can be considered as the epitome of the above phenomena. If the allies of yours are not feeling secure with you, then you have unquestionably lost your leverage. Amidst the power race between the USA and China, it is not going to help the USA. But there are also indispensable diplomats of White House, who may know what’s in it for the USA, and I am looking forward to understanding that explanation
<br/>
 <h4 className='py-3'>2. Advantage to Trump in joust against Biden </h4>

 Mr. Trump, predecessor of current President Biden, was the one who initiated and insisted on the talks of withdrawal of US forces under the “America First” campaign. He played exceptionally well in case of UAE, he was successful in case of Israel too and assassination of Baghdadi gave him an upper hand in foreign policy and strategy. He was the one who initiated a deal with the Taliban in the first place. In the recent address of Mr. Biden, he blamed his predecessor for the timing of withdrawal. But people and press are holding him accountable(Mr. Biden) for the manner in which troops were withdrawn and poor strategy of evacuation, which is fair also. And this is the reason, why Mr. Biden will have to face a problem. The generals and military officials who have served in AFG, are protesting against Mr. Biden for his disastrous decision making. This thing might drive people's opinion against him. And since it’s very clear from the current state of GOP, that he might very well return for 2024. So it’s certainly not a good omen for either Democratic Party or Mr. Biden.
<br/>
 <h4 className='py-3'>3. Resurrection of Al-Qaeda/ overall terrorism</h4>

 The two most notorious men of the 2000s, Mullah Omar(Supreme Leader of Taliban During first siege) and Osama Bin Laden(Leader of Al Qaeda) shared their friendship in Afg. Both were helpful to each other for their respective organisation’s growth. The activity of Al Qaeda was decreased drastically after assassination of Bin Laden in 2011. There was some news that his son was taking control of Al Qaeda, but the terrorist organisation was not so detrimental after. But if we look closely at the roots of Al Qaeda, it had strong connections with war lords in Afg. Hence there is high probability, that Afg in coming years might serve as hideaway for terrorism in Afg and Pakistan. This makes the resurrection of Al-Qaeda pretty much possible/feasible, which again will be a headache for the whole world.
<br/>
<h4 className='py-3'>4. Support of the Chinese government to the Taliban.
</h4>
 Just after the Taliban took control of Kabul, a Chinese spokesperson took a press conference and showed the interest to work with the new Taliban government. Because of China's narrative, the allies are also being supportive to the Taliban gov. This will make every other country’s counter terrorism campaign weak. A similar kind of thing is going to happen with Syria or Islamic Brotherhood because of Russia. But what’s in it for China? The answer for this thing is still obscure. But as per my knowledge, China may be seeing this as an opportunity to enter the mess of the Middle East. For the past decade, China has grown its influence in African countries, but eastern middle east was far from the influence of China. Now China has this opportunity. As time will pass, we will be more sure. 
<br/>
 <h4 className='py-3'>5. Investment of India in Afghanistan</h4>
 From the establishment of democratically chosen government in AFG, India has always been supportive to the Afghan government. The diplomatic relations between India and Afg were so pristine that India had huge infrastructure projects opened in the Afg. The official figure says India has invested more than $3 billion through its projects like schools, roads, dams etc. Apart from that, Afg was an important customer for Indian exports. The news regarding closure of Pakistan - Afghanistan border and trade route is upsetting for Indian businesses. The base of India’s massive investments in Afg, was mainly the presence of  NATO and US forces. The point I implied earlier, that America’s allies might get hurt from the unmannerly withdrawal of forces and may increase distrust about USA’s narrative was made in similar fashion. Again, what will happen with bilateral trade relations? The answer is unclear. But one thing is clear, that the Taliban reign is going to be a tough phase from an Indian perspective. Another nuisance for India is the dream of Taliban and its like organisations’ ,to conquer whole world for Islam. And that brings me to my final point.

<h4 className='py-3'>6. Clouds of war hovering over India?</h4>

 As Afg. is our neighbour, the possibility of war is undeniable to India. Pakistan, as beloved neighbour, having long left wish of Ghazwa-e-hind can find this as an opportunity. There is another trouble already existing in India. The communists of India, CPI, CPIM and people who have their sanctuary in Beijing, have literally left no stone unturned, to show their adulation for radical islamic terrorism. Whether it might be a “Hazar Lanatein” stunt from an international <a href = "https://www.opindia.com/2021/08/fact-checkers-altnews-ap-taliban-reuters/">award winning journalist</a> or “Condemn all you can” from a popular <a href = "">New York Times opinion writer</a>, intellectual Indian journalists have always, cleverly managed to miss the main point (whether by blaming the Bullet or Indian Prime minister). This fraternity is feeling titillated, by the Taliban takeover, might be serious concern for national security. The youth of peaceful community, mislead by such people and taught by religious preachers can really bring this war very close. And it's not just me who feels this way, but Mr. Tharoor also feels the same.

 This was my take on the whole situation. There are lot of topics regarding this like Deoband and Russian reaction to the scenario, but I have included the topics that can be gravely consequential in general context. I may have derived motivation from the following articles, hence I am putting their links below:
