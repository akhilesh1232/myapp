days the farmers protest is going on against the three Farmer laws passed by the Central Government on the borders of Delhi. The story of farmers laws is very critical, and many intellectuals have put their thoughts into this, so I won’t be bothering  anyone with my views on these farmer laws, but I am here to present my views on what is happening in India under the skin of farmers protest and is that really needed? So let me give you the quick recap of all these…<br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>\n            The farmer agitation started taking heat in Sept’20. The farmers (mainly from Punjab and Haryana) were asking for the removal of the three farm laws passed in parliament and the guarantee of the Minimum Support Price(MSP) for the crops. So, farmers from Punjab repelled these laws in their state and started to march to Delhi to make central government take them back. In way they got support from the farmer leaders from Haryana and they marched to Delhi. In way to Delhi they were blocked by police of Haryana but it was practically impossible to stop huge number o the farmers. Then all the farmers reached Delhi border and farmer leaders seemed permission to continue their protests on Ram Leela maidan which was denied, instead given another location which was further denied by the farmer leaders. So all the farmer leaders decided to stay at the border of Delhi-UP, Delhi-Punjab, Delhi-Haryana, Delhi-Rajasthan. And since then, the farmer protests are going on from the borders of Delhi.<br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>\n            This humongous movement is not lead by a single farmer union but it constitutes near about 80 farmer union and hence it is certain that movement has lot of leaders. The major faces among the crowd were Hannan Mollah, Rakesh Tikait, VM Singh, Yogendr Yadav, Media Patkar, Gurunam Singh Chadhuni, Balbir Singh Rajewal and many more. It’s interesting that from first day of the agitation, farmer leaders said that they won’t allow any political leader to get help of our movement and any political activity would not be entertained but most of the leaders are politician themselves and failed more than one time in general elections. Apart from that many arguable instances occurred when this movement was questionable, but the opposition party made such a fuss about all this issue which created a set that asking farmers why the anti-national things are happening under your watch(Mainly regarding Khalistan and the so-called intellectual jailed students) is simply questioning the patriotism and integrity of the farmers, which finally lead to massacre on 26 January. Before that, 11 rounds of unsuccessful conversation happened between Agriculture Minister Mr. Narendra Tomar, Rail Minister Mr. Piyush Goyal from government and all the leaders of Farmers to persuade the farmers about new laws. As the republic day was coming farmer leaders announced that they are going to arrange Tractor March in Delhi on republic day to pressurise the government. And then, everything started falling apart.<br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>\n            We all know what happened at Red fort Delhi on 26 January and we are seeing what is happening since then. The damage this march has caused to Farmers movement is unrecoverable. The top leaders of farmer protest are now on radar of police since the law has been broken and its more of a law and order situation than a simple protest.\n    In order to gain more support and empathy from public, the opposition parties are showing their support to these leaders.<br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span> The recent development in this chapter is the international pop star Rihanna tweeted that the why no one is talking about farmer protest going on in Delhi and the internet ban on border of New Delhi? The infamous environmentalist and human right activist Greta Thunberg and past pornstar Mia Khalifa also showed support to this movement. This became the new issue because the one who supported farmer litigation and other popular celebrity faces in India said that there is no need of international intervention on these issues, India is enough prepared to resolve its own issues. On the contrary side, those who oppose the laws and opposition party claimed the remarks of Rihanna, Mia and Greta were reasonable and government should now think about issue seriously and should take the laws back. But after some time shocking things came into light than this all (Rihanna’s and international figures’ tweets) was planned and it was well planner before month. The screenshot of Google Docs of the Greta Thunberg leaked and with the time and date it was written clearly that hoe the things are going to happen. The recent news is, the case against Greta Thunberg has been filed in Delhi and Mumbai. <br /><br />\n            I personally find these all matters, about the 26 jan R. Day violence and the tweets of such infamous personalities are a part of big propaganda or more of a conspiracy against the nation. Since the involvement of Khalistani activism in this movement is not hidden and we all know that the Khalistani activists are mostly located outside of the India and they run their racket remotely. And some of such activists are seen endorsing Rihanna for her tweet. The left front in our country (or in any country except China and Russia to be fair) is involved in every violence held against government. We have witnessed this in anti-CAA protests during last February, Shaheen Bagh- Delhi riots. So it would be mistake to think that the communist parties or their masters are not involved in this. <br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>Now lets talk about what government should do in this place. The government must find all the links of these tweets since the FIR has been filed against Greta, it would make government clear about what are roots of the violence and anti-national propaganda. On the other hand, government should think about how to convince the farmers about these laws because these laws does have strong support among the public and farmers, all across nation and many people believe that these reforms are needed to relieve India’s agriculture sector. Talking about the third side of it, the farmers front, once the moral support by population of nation to any movement is gone, the movement is likely to be dead. The farmers also need to understand that their supporting ground is collapsed after 26 January and there is sentiment against them in part of society. The farmers also need to realise that, blocking the capital of country for unknown time without having any rational discussion or oppose just to amuse some of union leaders is only going to make them look bad in overall sight. The first mistake this protest has done, is to involve anti national elements(knowingly or unknowingly). So without loosing the sanctity of the agitation, farmers also need to rethink their demand or at least start talking rationally about the farmer litigations with government and try to avoid the involvement of people with communist mindset in the protest because those are only reasons which could lead to end of this protest in unintentional ways. <br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>So let's hope that there will be a fair solution next time on the table, acceptable by both the parties and the nation could move on to the other important things.\n            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </>\n    );\n}\nexport default Blog1;","import React from 'react';\nimport \"../Blogs/Blog.css\";\n\nfunction Blog2(){\n    return(\n        <>\n            <div className=\"container-fluid\">\n                <div className=\"row\">\n                    <div className=\"col-10 mx-auto\">\n                        <div className=\"row\">\n                        <h1 className = \"mx-auto\" id=\"heading\">\n                    Indian Education System\n            </h1>\n            <p id=\"article\"> <span className=\"tab\"></span>“The future of nation is in the hands of youth”. As the slogan itself is mentioning the youth, it is concerned to education. And in this blog, I’m going to write my personal opinions about the current education system in India.<br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>\nThe Indian community has a great educational heritage. Our ancestors have written great Geeta, Ramayana, Vedas, Mahabharata, Upanishad and many more novels and plays, to bring about changes in the society. And for many generations, it was taught as part of syllabus. So we have a great historical background on education. Now looking at today’s education system, it is said that we are losing all our knowledge and wisdom for the word named “marks”. Colleges are trying to produce scholars in the sense of highest marks. I believe that some times the marks are telling your whole story but, “some times”. We often hear statements like “a single piece of paper can’t decide my future”. But from another point of view, you can’t rely only on your soft skills. Similarly there is no strong answer to the question that what’s wrong if you get good marks. You need to get good marks to prove yourself. So I have the humble opinion that everyone should maintain the marks since it’s not in our hands to change the marking systems.<br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>Another point on which I want your attention to is, primary and secondary education. Government is trying to focus on the overall development of children but on the ground level, it is not working. Still, parents want their children to study. They are putting sports and other soft skills after study. It is okay to make your children study, but forcing them only to study and not to let them do other things is somewhat wrong. I can’t totally blame this for the education system but some efforts must be done by the system on this and I must say the mindset of parents is changing now days.<br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>Continuing the above problem, we also need to take a look at the recruitment of teachers in universities and schools. If a master is not perfect in his job then how you can expect a student to be perfect in his job? So, the class of teacher teaching must be improved in every college and school. Every time you can’t point on students for not attending lectures and scoring poor marks there must be something mistake from other side. Sometimes it’s the situation that the teacher is an expert in the subject but due to poor communication skills and lack of interest in teaching makes him a boring ‘lecturer’.<br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>Although, there is not everything going wrong in our education system, there are many good things. The syllabus of central and state boards is good enough for students to learn ethics and many more things that teach you to how survive in the world. The most valuable asset of our system is maths. All across the world, it is proved that Indians are good mathematicians, they know how to solve difficult problems in an easy way. Another great thing to count, is that students are now more excited about the entrepreneurshipc which make them more mature and able to think of the world in better way. <br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>At last, the role of education in life is to make a child a good person with knowledge with which it can survive in competition, and help to make this world a better place. And till now our education system has done this job incredibly. But still, there is scope to improve. And let’s dream the world of tomorrow, with great personalities all around us in India and with help of which we can bring our honour of \"Vishvguru\" back.</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </>\n    );\n}\nexport default Blog2;","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../Blogs/Blog.css\";\n\nfunction Review1(){\n    return(\n        <>\n            <div className=\"container-fluid\">\n                <div className=\"row py-3\">\n                    <div className=\"col-10 mx-auto\">\n                        <div className=\"row\">\n                        <h1 className = \"mx-auto\" id=\"heading\">\n                        HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE\n            </h1>\n            <p id=\"article\">\n            Type: Web series<br />\n<br />Genre: Horror fiction, relationship, drama<br />\n<br />Episodes: 1 season 10 episodes.<br />\n<br />Significant characters: Steve Crain, Eleanor(Nell) Crain, Luke Crain, Theodora Crain, Olivia Crain, Hugh Crain, Shirley Crain<br />\n<br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>The series is based on a Horror fiction novel “Haunting of hill house” written by Shirley Jackson. The story of the series is based on Crain family and incidents about the spine-chilling and mysterious house they used to live in. Steve, Eleanor, Theodora, Luke, Shirley are all siblings and Hugh and Olivia are their parents. The Hugh and his wife Olivia were in poor financial condition hence they purchased a old manor and thought that after renovation they could sell that at the elevated price. For renovation, they stayed in that mansion but there was a haunting past releated to that house. The time they lived there, all the siblings were minor and the story tells us how this all weird and frightening sort of things happened in the house made their impact on the lives of respective characters.Now all the siblings are grown up and independent. Their mother had strange kind of impact of all of such weird things on her mind which eventually lead to death of her, leaving her children clueless about tragedy happened to their mother, and now they are not so close with their father because children hold father responsible for catastrophic death of their mother.\n<br /><br /><strong className = \"btn btn-success\">Things I liked</strong><br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>Story starts from the suicide of the Eleanor/ Nell Crain(Twin sister of Luke Crain) in the same old house.The horror things start to happen and we come across the many past events from each of characters’ life which perfectly explains how the events happened in childhood could affect the personality of the person. The narration is combination of the past events from their life and current scenes and this explores the relationships in family very well. The star cast has also performed well in every scenario, either it may be tensed arguments or scary horror scenes or the story revealing climax scenes(Especially the scene of suicide of Nell). The show is excellently directed and written if we consider the darkness of story, mystery elevating silence , management of the screen appearance and significance of all the characters till end etc. Another quality of the show is, it ends well. The ending of story is appropriate and nothing exaggerating is shown. The scenes which describe the relationship of children and their mother are incredibly well filmed. They are directed in such a way that you are left with no choice other than to love the kind of bond they share. \n<br /><br /><strong className=\"btn btn-warning\">Things I didn't like</strong><br /><br /><span className=\"tab\"></span>Even though show contains ghosts but the ghosts are dead men and are not much scary. The scary scenes fails to scare you, that may be the downfall. The darkness of shooting and story seems more horror than the actual ghosts and scary scenes. (One who don’t like the frightening scenes might like this quality).\n            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </>\n    );\n}\nexport default Review1;","import React from 'react';\nimport { NavLink, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Blog1 from \"../src/Blogs/Blog1\";\nimport Blog2 from \"../src/Blogs/Blog2\";\nimport Review1 from './Blogs/Review1';\n\n\nconst View = (props) =>{\n    const location = useLocation();\n    const num = props.location.viewProps.number;\n    if(num===1)\n    {   return(\n        <>\n            <Blog1 /> \n        </>\n        );\n    }\n    if(num===2)\n    {\n        return(\n            <>\n                <Blog2 />\n            </>\n        );\n    }\n    if(num===\"1r\")\n    {\n        return(\n            <>\n                <Review1 />\n            </>\n        );\n    }\n}\nexport default View;","import React from \"react\";\nimport {NavLink} from \"react-router-dom\";\nconst Reviews = () =>{\n    return(\n            <>\n            <div className=\"continer-fluid my-3\">\n            <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-10 mx-auto\">\n            <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col\">\n                <div className=\"card\">      \n                <div className=\"card-body\">\n                    <h5 className=\"card-title\">The Haunting of Hill House</h5>\n                    <p className=\"card-text\">Uploaded on 8/2/021</p>\n                    <NavLink to={{\n                        pathname: \"/View\",\n                        viewProps: {\n                            number:\"1r\"\n                        }\n                }} className=\"btn btn-success\">Read</NavLink>\n                </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col\">\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col\">\n            </div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n            </>\n    );\n}\nexport default Reviews;","import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Contact from './Contact';\nimport Content from \"./Content\";\nimport Navbar from './Navbar';\nimport Home from './Home';\nimport View from \"./View\";\nimport Reviews from \"./Reviews\";\nimport {BrowserRouter, Redirect, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport \"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\";\nimport \"bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Navbar />\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component = { Home } />\n        <Route exact path=\"/Blogs\" component = { Content } />\n        <Route exact path=\"/Reviews\" component = {Reviews} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/Contact\" component = { Contact } />\n        <Route exact path=\"/View\" component = { View } />\n        <Redirect to = \"/\" />\n      </Switch>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
