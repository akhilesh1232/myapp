The farmers (mainly from Punjab and Haryana) were asking for the removal of the three farm laws passed in parliament and the guarantee of the Minimum Support Price(MSP) for the crops. So, farmers from Punjab repelled these laws in their state and started to march to Delhi to make central government take them back. In way they got support from the farmer leaders from Haryana and they marched to Delhi. In way to Delhi they were blocked by police of Haryana but it was practically impossible to stop huge number o the farmers. Then all the farmers reached Delhi border and farmer leaders seemed permission to continue their protests on Ram Leela maidan which was denied, instead given another location which was further denied by the farmer leaders. So all the farmer leaders decided to stay at the border of Delhi-UP, Delhi-Punjab, Delhi-Haryana, Delhi-Rajasthan.

The major faces among the crowd were Hannan Mollah, Rakesh Tikait, VM Singh, Yogendr Yadav, Media Patkar, Gurunam Singh Chadhuni, Balbir Singh Rajewal and many more. It\u2019s interesting that from first day of the agitation, farmer leaders said that they won\u2019t allow any political leader to get help of our movement and any political activity would not be entertained but most of the leaders are politician themselves and failed more than one time in general elections. Apart from that many arguable instances occurred when this movement was questionable, but the opposition party made such a fuss about all this issue which created a set that asking farmers why the anti-national things are happening under your watch(Mainly regarding Khalistan and the so-called intellectual jailed students) is simply questioning the patriotism and integrity of the farmers, which finally lead to massacre on 26 January. Before that, 11 rounds of unsuccessful conversation happened between Agriculture Minister Mr. Narendra Tomar, Rail Minister Mr. Piyush Goyal from government and all the leaders of Farmers to persuade the farmers about new laws.

This became the new issue because the one who supported farmer litigation and other popular celebrity faces in India said that there is no need of international intervention on these issues, India is enough prepared to resolve its own issues. On the contrary side, those who oppose the laws and opposition party claimed the remarks of Rihanna, Mia and Greta were reasonable and government should now think about issue seriously and should take the laws back. But after some time shocking things came into light than this all (Rihanna\u2019s and international figures\u2019 tweets) was planned and it was well planner before month. The screenshot of Google Docs of the Greta Thunberg leaked and with the time and date it was written clearly that hoe the things are going to happen.

Day violence and the tweets of such infamous personalities are a part of big propaganda or more of a conspiracy against the nation. Since the involvement of Khalistani activism in this movement is not hidden and we all know that the Khalistani activists are mostly located outside of the India and they run their racket remotely. And some of such activists are seen endorsing Rihanna for her tweet. The left front in our country (or in any country except China and Russia to be fair) is involved in every violence held against government. We have witnessed this in anti-CAA protests during last February, Shaheen Bagh- Delhi riots. So it would be mistake to think that the communist parties or their masters are not involved in this.

On the other hand, government should think about how to convince the farmers about these laws because these laws does have strong support among the public and farmers, all across nation and many people believe that these reforms are needed to relieve India\u2019s agriculture sector. Talking about the third side of it, the farmers front, once the moral support by population of nation to any movement is gone, the movement is likely to be dead. The farmers also need to understand that their supporting ground is collapsed after 26 January and there is sentiment against them in part of society. The farmers also need to realise that, blocking the capital of country for unknown time without having any rational discussion or oppose just to amuse some of union leaders is only going to make them look bad in overall sight. The first mistake this protest has done, is to involve anti national elements(knowingly or unknowingly). So without loosing the sanctity of the agitation, farmers also need to rethink their demand or at least start talking rationally about the farmer litigations with government and try to avoid the involvement of people with communist mindset in the protest because those are only reasons which could lead to end of this protest in unintentional ways.

Now looking at today\u2019s education system, it is said that we are losing all our knowledge and wisdom for the word named \u201cmarks\u201d. Colleges are trying to produce scholars in the sense of highest marks. I believe that some times the marks are telling your whole story but, \u201csome times\u201d. We often hear statements like \u201ca single piece of paper can\u2019t decide my future\u201d. But from another point of view, you can\u2019t rely only on your soft skills. Similarly there is no strong answer to the question that what\u2019s wrong if you get good marks. You need to get good marks to prove yourself. So I have the humble opinion that everyone should maintain the marks since it\u2019s not in our hands to change the marking systems.",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("span",{className:"tab"}),"Another point on which I want your attention to is, primary and secondary education. Government is trying to focus on the overall development of children but on the ground level, it is not working. Still, parents want their children to study. They are putting sports and other soft skills after study. It is okay to make your children study, but forcing them only to study and not to let them do other things is somewhat wrong. I can\u2019t totally blame this for the education system but some efforts must be done by the system on this and I must say the mindset of parents is changing now days.",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("span",{className:"tab"}),"Continuing the above problem, we also need to take a look at the recruitment of teachers in universities and schools. If a master is not perfect in his job then how you can expect a student to be perfect in his job? So, the class of teacher teaching must be improved in every college and school. Every time you can\u2019t point on students for not attending lectures and scoring poor marks there must be something mistake from other side. Sometimes it\u2019s the situation that the teacher is an expert in the subject but due to poor communication skills and lack of interest in teaching makes him a boring \u2018lecturer\u2019.",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("span",{className:"tab"}),"Although, there is not everything going wrong in our education system, there are many good things. The syllabus of central and state boards is good enough for students to learn ethics and many more things that teach you to how survive in the world. The most valuable asset of our system is maths. All across the world, it is proved that Indians are good mathematicians, they know how to solve difficult problems in an easy way. Another great thing to count, is that students are now more excited about the entrepreneurshipc which make them more mature and able to think of the world in better way. ",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("span",{className:"tab"}),'At last, the role of education in life is to make a child a good person with knowledge with which it can survive in competition, and help to make this world a better place. And till now our education system has done this job incredibly. But still, there is scope to improve. And let\u2019s dream the world of tomorrow, with great personalities all around us in India and with help of which we can bring our honour of "Vishvguru" back.']})]})})})})})};var f=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(i.Fragment,{children:Object(i.jsx)("div",{className:"container-fluid",children:Object(i.jsx)("div",{className:"row py-3",children:Object(i.jsx)("div",{className:"col-10 mx-auto",children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"row",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h1",{className:"mx-auto",id:"heading",children:"HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE"}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{id:"article",children:["Type: Web series",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),"Genre: Horror fiction, relationship, drama",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),"Episodes: 1 season 10 episodes.",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),"Significant characters: Steve Crain, Eleanor(Nell) Crain, Luke Crain, Theodora Crain, Olivia Crain, Hugh Crain, Shirley Crain",Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsx)("span",{className:"tab"}),"The series is based on a Horror fiction novel \u201cHaunting of hill house\u201d written by Shirley Jackson.
